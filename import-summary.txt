ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From CMSSDK:
* proguard-project.txt
From CMSSDK-GUI:
* proguard-project.txt
From MobDependency:
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In MobDependency:
* AndroidManifest.xml => mobDependency\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => mobDependency\src\main\assets\
* libs\Jimu-2017.0807.1541.jar => mobDependency\libs\Jimu-2017.0807.1541.jar
* libs\MobCommons-2017.0807.1541.jar => mobDependency\libs\MobCommons-2017.0807.1541.jar
* libs\MobTools-2017.0807.1541.jar => mobDependency\libs\MobTools-2017.0807.1541.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Core-3.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\ShareSDK-Core-3.0.0.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-3.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-3.0.0.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-QQ-3.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\ShareSDK-QQ-3.0.0.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-3.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-3.0.0.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-3.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-3.0.0.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-3.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-3.0.0.jar
* libs\SMSSDK-3.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\SMSSDK-3.0.0.jar
* libs\UMSSDK-1.0.0.jar => mobDependency\libs\UMSSDK-1.0.0.jar
* res\ => mobDependency\src\main\res\
* src\ => mobDependency\src\main\java\
In CMSSDK:
* AndroidManifest.xml => cMSSDK\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\CMSSDK-1.0.0.jar => cMSSDK\libs\CMSSDK-1.0.0.jar
* res\ => cMSSDK\src\main\res\
* src\ => cMSSDK\src\main\java
In CMSSDK-GUI:
* AndroidManifest.xml => CMSSDKGUI\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => CMSSDKGUI\src\main\assets\
* res\ => CMSSDKGUI\src\main\res\
* src\ => CMSSDKGUI\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
